## Hi there 

My name is Lisa van Mansom and I am studying Frontend design & development at the Hva. During my study I have learnt the best practices of HTML, CSS and JavaScript and how to use it in a creative way. This year I have started using tech stacks like SvelteKit and React. In my free time, to enhance more skills, I have decided to start learning WebGL, Gsap and other JS libraries. Additionally, I am well-versed in the latest innovations within the frontend sector, for example I have worked with container queries and view transitions. As a person I am ambitious, very eager to learn, structured and I work well together. Furthermore, I have an eye for detail, and I think it is important to work intelligently to deliver work at a high customer level.

Outside of coding, I am passionate about diving into classic and contemporary literature, as I believe every book offers a fresh perspective on the world. I love the energy and creativity of live music, and going to concerts is one of my favorite ways to unwind and get inspired. I also value spending quality time with friends, as those moments help me recharge and bring balance to my life.
