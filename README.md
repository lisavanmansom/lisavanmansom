## Hi there 

My name is Lisa van Mansom, I'm a junior frontend developer recently graduated from the Frontend Design & Development study at the HvA. Iâ€™ve built a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and SvelteKit, and gained hands-on experience with Next.js during my internship at Bravoure. I also learned to integrate AI-assisted tools into my workflow to boost productivity and explore new ways of working more efficiently.

Iâ€™m passionate about web accessibility and love combining creativity with thoughtful code to craft inclusive, user-centered experiences. Curious and ambitious, Iâ€™m always eager to keep learning and growing as a developer.
